Extract OCR (module for Omeka S)
================================


Module for Omeka S to extract OCR text in XML and TSV from PDF files, allowing
instant fulltext searching and highlighting within any IIIF viewer like
Universal Viewer or Mirador with [IIIF-Search module](https://github.com/bubdxm/Omeka-S-module-IiifSearch)).

For search, the tsv format (tab-separated values, a simpler variant of csv
spreadsheets) is recommended because it is a lot quicker, in particular for items
with many pages. The tsv format is a simple columns with the words and the list
of positions by page. It allows to highlight search results in iiif viewers.

The xml format is the simple [pdf2xml](https://poppler.freedesktop.org) or the
most common standard [alto](https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto). It allows to
display the transcription in IIIF viewers. It can be used for search and
highlight too, but it is slower. The pdf2xml format is not a standard, but it
allows smaller files and a slightly faster search, but a slighly less accurate
display. For alto, it is a valid but basic alto that does not contains metadata
about fonts or structure.

There are two tsv formats: the words can be stored globally, so the index is
smaller and the search is quicker, or one by one, so an exact search can be done
when there are multiple words and the search wrapped with `"`. The tsv format
does not allows to display the transcription in IIIF viewers, but it allows to
highlight results. The global index contains two columns: string and positions.
The full index contains three columns: string, page, xywh (a list of four
numbers for top left x and y, width and height, directly usable for iiif search).

So generally, it is recommended to use formats "tsv" for search and "alto" for
display.


Installation
------------

- This module needs `pdftohtml` command-line tool on your server, from the
  poppler utilities:

```sh
# Debian and derivatives
sudo apt install poppler-utils
# Red Hat and derivatives
sudo dnf install poppler-utils
```

- **Before Omeka S version 3.1**, the module requires to set the base uri in the
  config file of Omeka `config/local.config.php` in order to upload the file in
  background:

```php
    'file_store' => [
        'local' => [
            'base_path' => null, // Or the full path on the server if needed.
            'base_uri' => 'https://example.org/files', // To be removed in Omeka S v3.1.
        ],
    ],
```

- Upload and unzip the Extract OCR module folder into your modules folder on the
  server, or you can install the module via github:

```sh
cd omeka-s/modules
git clone git@github.com:bubdxm/Omeka-S-module-ExtractOcr.git "ExtractOcr"
```

- Take care to rename the folder "ExtractOcr".
- Install it from the admin → Modules → Extract Ocr -> install
- Extract OCR automatically allows the upload of XML files.


Using the Extract OCR module
---------------------------

- Create an item
- Save this Item
- After save, add PDF file(s) to this item
- To locate extracted OCR xml or tsv file, select the item to which the PDF is
  attached. Normally, you should see an XML or a tsv file attached to the record
  with the same filename than the pdf file.


Optional modules
----------------

- [IIIF-Server](https://github.com/bubdxm/Omeka-S-module-IiifServer): Module for
  Omeka S that adds the IIIF specifications to serve any images and medias.
- [IIIF-Search](https://github.com/bubdxm/Omeka-S-module-IiifSearch):  Module
  for Omeka S that adds IIIF Search Api for fulltext searching on universal
  viewer.
- [Universal Viewer](https://gitlab.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-UniversalViewer):
  Module for Omeka S that includes UniversalViewer, a unified online player for
  any file. It can display books, images, maps, audio, movies, pdf, 3D views,
  and anything else as long as the appropriate extensions are installed.
- [Mirador](https://gitlab.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Mirador)
- Or any other IIIF viewers, like [Diva](https://gitlab.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Mirador).


TODO
----

- [x] Extract strings with pdftotext with arg -tsv and store them in a file or in database for simpler and quicker search.
- [x] Extract strings by word, but with one position by row, allowing to search with "AND", not only "OR".
- [ ] Add a php format for quicker loading?
